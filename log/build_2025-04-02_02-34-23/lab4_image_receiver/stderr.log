CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmarker_array.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "marker_array", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "marker_array" with
  any of the following names:

    marker_arrayConfig.cmake
    marker_array-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "marker_array" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "marker_array_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "marker_array" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
